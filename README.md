## About:

The Time Management Matrix is a tool for effective time management that includes multiple user databases and additional features. It enables efficient time analysis and prioritization of tasks based on their urgency and importance.


## Purpose and Uses:  
- Helps prioritise and retrospect your tasks.  
- Can be used and as a daily tool to store the day’s activities.  
- Based on antecedent inputs from the users, the program suggests the next day’s activities.  
- Linking the multiple user databases, program suggests intervals when the users as a group would be free. This aids in effective scheduling of group activities like get togethers, parties, meetings, classes etc

# Milestones (for Ingenius Framework Track)
- Implement Multiplayer functionality so that multiple clients can update time data in real time and it is reflected.
- Implement support for multiple users
